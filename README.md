# SEM race bootcamp
Short Python code as an example how Python can be for analysing the Telemetry Data from the Shell Eco-marathon. Also see the corresponding website from [Schmid Elektronik](https://schmid-elektronik.ch/racebootcamp/) and the [Telemetry Wiki](https://telemetry.sem-app.com/wiki/doku.php/telemetry_data/home) where additional information can be found.

## Launch with Binder
The Jupyter Notebooks can be run using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/). The dependencies are then automatically loaded. This will take a few minutes to finish, but afterwards the code can be edited in a virtual environment. Remember to save changes you are making to the code.
